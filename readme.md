# vimsuite

This is a vim suite for me , also for you , if you are a coder.

## Supported Distro:

* MacOS 10.9
* Debian 7
* CentOS 5
* CentOS 6


### why there is no windows support?

All programmer, should be starting your learning from Linux/Unix.

If you have not yet know Linux/Unix, you really should know more about it.

Windows is a good platform to Users, but not a good platform to Developers.

All power and wise developer should using Linux/Unix , even MacOS, better more than Windows.

No BSOD, No virus. No pain.

So We decide not support Windows as these time.

Try Linux/Unix, or MacOS, you should see a new world.
